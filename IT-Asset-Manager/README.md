# IT Asset Manager â€“ PowerShell Script

A lightweight PowerShell-based tool to manage and track IT equipment (laptops, monitors, peripherals, etc.) using a simple CSV file. Ideal for small IT departments or individual IT coordinators who need a quick and effective way to track assets without expensive software.

---
## Features

- View all tracked IT assets
- Add new assets with automatic ID generation
- Update asset details interactively
- Search assets by Asset ID
- Generate a usage report (CSV export)
- Persistent data storage using `assets.csv`

---

## How It Works

- On first run, it creates `assets.csv` with proper headers
- Uses a menu-driven interface to guide user actions
- Generates new Asset IDs like `AST-0001`, `AST-0002`, etc.
- Creates a report called `report.csv` listing all "In Use" assets and a summary by asset type

---

## Asset Fields

Each asset includes:

- `AssetID` (auto-generated)
- `AssetType` (e.g., Laptop, Monitor)
- `Brand`
- `Model`
- `SerialNumber`
- `AssignedTo`
- `Status` (In Use, In Stock, Repair, Retired)
- `Location`
- `PurchaseDate`
- `Notes`

## Why I Built This

> I created this tool to solve a real-world need: tracking IT equipment in environments without full-scale ITAM software. This project demonstrates my scripting skills, automation mindset, and ability to create practical solutions that save time and reduce asset loss.

	â€¢	Improved Efficiency: Significantly reduced the time it takes to track, update, and audit IT assets by replacing manual spreadsheets with an interactive script.
	â€¢	Lower Risk of Asset Loss: By assigning unique Asset IDs and tracking status/location, the tool minimizes asset misplacement or oversight.
	â€¢	Scalable for Small Teams: Enables small IT teams or solo IT coordinators to implement structured asset management without costly software.

## Output Files
